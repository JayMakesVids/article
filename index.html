    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq-question">What games are available?</div>
    <br>
    <div class="faq-answer">I offer a wide variety of unblocked games, including classics and popular titles.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="faq-question">Why do you require download?</div>
    <br>
    <div class="faq-answer">As a high schooler myself, I understand how schools can block links immediately based off popularity and DNS server types and such. If download is required, all of that is completely bypassed (because it is on your local system, not the internet), thus making it easy to unblock titles and games.
        <br><br>Though, do not worry! The download file is completely safe and only consists of HTML, CSS, and JS. Download size is a little bit more on the higher-end, though it is worth it to play your favorite titles locally (meaning NO lag!), and unblocked!
